# Netwink

Code for Team Netwink's app for HackViolet 2022.

Netwink is a social media platform tailored towards empowering women from all industries in a remote space that they can access through their mobile and computer devices. We grant women the opportunities to engage in their field while being safely distanced from the stigma of falling under the minority. Whether it be by personal connections or community engagement, Netwink provides its users the simplest access to interact with women that understand their world and grant them a place to call home. We additionally assist high school and university students as they play an integral part of structuring our sisterhood by helping them become the future leaders of our generation. Users can navigate through a series of inspirational posts, locate their dream jobs with ease, interact with an AI program to make new connections, exchange messages with users, and gain the skills to enhance as a leader and spread an everlasting sisterhood to wider arenas. Users can also navigate small features such as studying the charts displayed in the profile and website prototypes and to get a stronger comprehension of their profile status and job searches. We do what it takes to build the comfort and confidence for a woman to recognize her capabilities and play her part in our ever advancing society.
